Black indigo papers come in a pack of one hundred. Sorry, it's not possible to buy just one.
The search for a single banality is over. The need is satisfied by 10,000%. Eleven phone calls later,
110 numeric values on the screen and 100 sheets in one package,
we are left with 99% excess—unused.

Rest. From one screen to another.
That’s another story and finally, it feels easier to breathe.
We watch freely instead of out of obligation. Or do we?
Grandma is crying in the background.
On the screen, the boy next to me launches a missile at a family of ten.
Life in collective anesthesia to discomfort and empathy is easy—as long as the oasis provides content.
Still, even the oasis isn't immune to echoes of global horrors.
It’s indifferent until it spills too close to a wound.
The work critiques the absence of empathy and the unwillingness for necessary conversations in a time of ever-available connection.
Pretty pictures remain pretty even when they speak of pain, or not?

 A green thorn in the heart of the city stabs the eyes of those with unclean tears.
The link was always the bridge.
We bend bones and break young branches just to forget how to grow—if only for a moment, while we’re still important.
Two sides and a peace treaty—we rip it apart.
We stay and shout, but one side is already compromised.
20 days of struggle bore loud ignorance.
Grown into the loud ignorance of machines,
and the rails gave in silently while they tied blindfolds on us.
In the end, this was all just a dream.
The thorn never existed.
Our palms just itched.

 I always feel dirty.
A dirty Balkan woman, a girl with menstruation too unclean for liturgy.
I don’t have the strength for hygiene—work is the priority.
My thoughts are dirty, my needs are dirty.
Dirty, anxious, my palms are sweaty, hormones are shaking me,
I have a hormonal imbalance.
It’s dirty, hairy—I flush red with my probably half-Turkish genetics.
Dirty, southern—everything is dirty here, worn out and destroyed—we are peasants.
Dirty—no clean girl aesthetic here, I wear colorful second-hand oversized shirts.
Dirty and greasy—greasy skin and hair, the guy or fried food?
Dirty—greasy bacon and expired food, dirty—nothing goes to waste.
I live dirty and alone without guilt, I live dirty and together with guilt.

      The riverbed is empty.
My sorrow sleeps.
Curled up and small, wrapped in black.
The mirrors are dry.
Transparent reality no longer hurts.
The eruption extinguished long ago.
Under the skin, restlessness shapes me.
A step forward into living quicksand.
I try to catch irreversible time mid-flight.
The film rolls and skips, chokes, pushes, clatters.
My voice is still far away.
Oh, darkened eye, unruly eye, shameless eye—
isn’t it easier that way?
While the film rolls and skips, chokes, pushes, clatters,
I seek my urges again.
I rush into memories again.
Dewy eyes, nettles in my throat.

      We all live in contradictions—tired, yet full of incredible energy.
This work aims to explore both personal and collective struggles of dealing with our situation,
and to translate the mental boundaries we carry into reality.
Unwelcome in Rome, the thoughts I locked away there—I now release.

 My father became a parent while still a child.
While grandma and grandpa lived and worked in Germany,
he was the only constant figure my uncle—his younger brother—had in early childhood.
For this project, I chose to use some of the rare photographs where the whole family is together—carefree and smiling.
I specifically chose those expressing closeness—hugging, celebration, play.
By intervening with red color over the skin of the father and uncle, and blue tones over the grandparents,
I aimed to visually emphasize the concept of warmth as a metaphor for presence/absence.
Red, as pure childlike joy, versus blue—grown-up and tired from the road.
At points where their bodies touch, I add embroidery to highlight the tactile as essential to this topic.
The rest of the photos remain monochrome—as a way to spotlight the long-awaited touch in a certain space and time,
as the only thing radiating from the memories that remain.
I ask: how is distance remembered?
What is the physical sensation of absence of closeness?

     self-curated is a virtual gallery, i.e., a private collection of artworks,
but without owning the original works—only their reproductions on mass-produced objects.
Referencing Benjamin’s essay “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” and the idea of the aura lost in reproduction,
the gallery aims to comment on several social parallels.

      Four Walls is a publication made for the Graphic Design course, in response to the theme "body."
I interpreted the body through one of the strongest emotions that consumes me—so much so that I sometimes forget what life is without it—
shame. I broke shame down into a residential unit made up of four sub-emotions, or walls: humiliation, betrayal, rejection, and masochism.
The publication begins with an ad announcing the “rental” of this space.
Each emotion is represented through a different paper texture and quality,
followed by pages with accompanying text and photographs meant to evoke the same feeling.

    homo saltarus, or the dancing human, is a project created for the Typography Basics course.
A video of feet/hands was added to a given base (half-text in Helvetica),
to create a hybrid form of static and motion—aiming to best represent this phrase.
